# ReactJS formik and yup exercise

we created a registration form with formic and yup. 
we set certain rules and if they are not followed an error message is shown. 
When creating the form with formik, with yup we set rules and defined error conditions.
After saving the form, we made adjustments so that the form is reset within 1 second.
